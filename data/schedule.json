  {"title":"Keynote: Jonathan Zittrain",
   "time":"1:00PM",
   "desc": "Jonathan is Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and co-founder of The Berkman Center for Internet and Society. He currently serves on the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and is the author of the brilliant innovation-theory-slash-techno-dystopian screed The Future of the Internet — and How To Stop It. So suffice it to say, he’s kind of an all-star internet smartypants. Perhaps most importantly, he’s one of the most kickass and entertaining speakers that it has ever been the pleasure of the ROFLStaff to witness. So, kick back, relax, and let the man open up ROFLCon weekend for you.",
